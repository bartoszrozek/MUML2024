# Project A Checkpoint

## Bartosz Rożek, Jakub Szypuła

Progress so far:
- we have implemented MIFS, JMI, Minimax and LASSO methods for feature selection.
- we have created two artificial datasets (for one MIFS works for the other does not) and selected 5 different real life UCI datasets
- we have started running tests on these datasets.
